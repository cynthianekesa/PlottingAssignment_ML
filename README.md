# Plotting_Matplotlib Seaborn, Histograms and Boxplots

This is the first assignment of the 2.3 Trisemester at ALU. I have begun my specialization in Machine Learning and this assignment is found under the module Mathematics for Machine Learning. The purpose of the assignment is to learn the use of Matplotlib together with other libraries and Colab to create plots while interpreting them hence making sense of the csv data given.

#### Assignment 1-Canvas(Instructions)
The most recent ASC23 considered four major systems-based tracks with a view to providing region-focused contributions to inform the global stocktake among them Cities, urban and rural settlements, infrastructure, and transport.

In this assignment, you will be performing analysis more specifically on transport (vehicles and fuel efficiency). 
The dataset has been provided for you.

You are tasked to make sense of this data that will later be used for AI purposes.

For this assignment, you will use the matplotlib library and seaborn to create diagrams that visualize the relationship between various features (columns) and interpret the diagrams. The steps include:

-Accessing the starter notebook here; https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CL91TV8rEO5F59CvNh2H85GfTVh1Yvp/view?usp=sharing and data here; https://drive.google.com/file/d/16lgiSKILxHaLqmNUkCafQIAvyL2Y_KYf/view?usp=sharing; Download and upload to your own drive. 
-Import the necessary libraries. Expect a minimum of 4 libraries to import the data Correctly and display a few rows,  (4 <rows< 11) 
-Create the plots (Plot a histogram and a heatmap) Output should be visible on the notebook
-Correctly interpret the diagrams. Interpretation should be on a cell in the notebook as a text or python comment
-Export and Submit the PNG files (in a folder) and source code file (notebook).
-Note: This assignment accounts to 16% of your total Grades
-Submit a Github link of your notebook. Make sure all outputs of the cells are visible in your submission.
